    <section class="col-xs-12">
      <p>The planet Peep is located in Mayall’s Object in the Ursa Major constellation, 500 million light years away from earth.  It is the result of the collision of two galaxies.  When the peeps first realized that there was possibly going to be a collision of the galaxies, there was a wide variety of ideas on how to deal with the situation.  One of the main problems was that the scientists  couldn’t predict that the collision would definitely occur and that Peep would be destroyed along with all its inhabitants.  This at first caused great unrest since many resources were needed  to study the problem and sacrifices would have to be made.  Many of the peeps at first didn’t want to make these sacrifices for an event that they weren’t even sure would occur.  Several of the leaders believed that things worked out before, so they would again, there was no need for these sacrifices. There was a total breakdown of cooperation between the groups,  they all wanted the largest share of the financing and glory that would go with saving Peep.  Energy and funds were wasted not only on duplicating ideas that didn’t work, but energy was spent on learning how to put up defenses to mind melding, to prevent the various groups from stealing an idea from another group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peeps began hoarding supplies, even though the collision would not occur for many years to come.  This caused the companies to manufacture more supplies and use more of the limited resources.  Things did not look good for the future of peep, whether the planet survived or not.
  The fear was causing rational behavior to be tossed out the window, panic was beginning to take over.  Most of the peeps were just keeping their heads down and trying to figure out the best way to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some unknown reason several small groups of peeps began talking to each other and saying they were better than this.  They believed in the survival of all the peeps, they could find a way, if they would find a way to work together.  They began talking to each other in these isolated groups, supporting each other, discovering how the strengths of each could be best exploited to insure a better outcome.  These groups began to reach out to other peeps and the movement grew.  Eventually their discussions drowned out the others.  They argued that even though they couldn’t be sure that a collision would occur they were better off trying to solve the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they all strove to solve this problem, many advances in other areas occurred.  They developed peep mobiles so they could travel faster than the speed of light, communication systems were developed to cross these vast distances, mind melding was perfected.  Robots were developed to deal with many of the dangerous or mundane tasks of life.
  As the day of the collision drew closer the peeps began sending their peep mobiles out into space to search for another home planet.  They believed there was never going to be another planet as good as Peep, but some would come close.  This exploration also led them to meet a wide variety of other species and expand their knowledge.  Some of these worlds the peeps left undisturbed and some they initiated contact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peep ended up surviving the collision, but the belief of peepism that evolved from this situation continued to be the life force for the peeps.  They continued to expand their technology so they could visit more and more galaxies spreading peepism if they felt it would help the species they discovered.  They continued to expand their technology to allow peeps to have more time to play and enjoy life.  They retained the belief that working together mind melding they could create a larger brain and solve any problems that confronted them in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of the planet earth now rests with the peeps willingness to convert the human species to peepists

      <h2>Meet the Peeps</h2>
      <p>As more and more peep tumblers arrive on earth the peeps are forming
        more clandestine sleeper cells, waiting to be summoned to action when needed.
        This Peep cell contains 19 very unique peeps.
        They each have different strengths and interests.  Combined together
        they believe they have an excellent chance to convert the human species
        into peepists and thus save the humans and the planet earth. They peeps
        have recently formed a facebook group called <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/793346537480179/" >Peep Power</a> where you
        can follow some of there activities.  They hope to update it weekly,
        but peeps aren't the best at keeping a schedule, life frequently interferes
        with their best intentions.

                Tig is the captain of this peep cell.  He not only piloted the peep mobile from peep, but was in charge of the rescue mission to free Andre.  After Andre’s rescue, all the peeps wanted to quickly return home, but Tig felt a strange compassion for the human species.  He felt that the fate of the human species could be changed if they would only convert to peepism.  The other peeps thought it was a lost cause and did not share Tig’s feeling of compassion for the human species.  They felt that the humans brought all these problems on themselves.  Tig argued that this was largely true, but there were a few unlucky breaks.  He also argued the humans currently controlled the fate of the earth and thus the fate of all the other living species on earth, which was extremely unjust.  When the peeps thought of the potential loss of innocent life they agreed to help hatch a plan to convert the human species in mass to peepism. They felt with the current chaos in the world there was a good chance that much of the conversion would take place without anyone noticing. If they were found out they felt some positive spin, alternative facts, and a good multimedia advertising campaign would reassure the population that they were harmless.  All they had to do was promise change, that they were not elites or politicians, they were just one of the people.

                Oliver is in charge of night navigation and mind melding.  The peeps are able to mind
                meld, to all share one mind.  They have observed something similar to this in the human
                 adolescent male group dynamic.  The similarity being that they share one mind, in the
                 peeps case the mind increases in size with each additional peep, where in the adolescent
                  male humans the one mind stays the same size with each male adolescent making up a
                  smaller share of it.  This causes the peeps to make better decisions, where the male
                  adolescent group is more prone to make a poor decision.  The peeps were at first hopeful
                  they were seeing the evolution of their mind melding as it occurred thousands of years ago
                  on Peep.  After their continued study of the human race they are concerned this is just
                   a genetic abnormality, one that will need to be modified during the conversion to peepism.
                Oliver’s favorite activity is navigating at night.  He enjoys soaring under the moonlit
                sky and is learning the new constellations.  He misses the colorful night skies of Peep,
                where the stars are different hues.  He became homesick over the Christmas season with all
                 the colorful lights.

                Originally the peeps felt that saving the human species and planet earth would be impossible just because of the sheer number of humans.  They thought that they may have to individually mind meld with each human to convert them to peepism, this would have proved to be an impossible task due to the overwhelming ratio of humans to peeps, even with the continued arrival of new peeps.  After joining several social media outlets, including facebook and twitter, and watching endless hours of reality tv and YouTube vidioes, they realized there was a small subset of humans considered to be celebrities who had a large influence on human society.  If they could infiltrate this celebrity culture, there was a chance they could convert large numbers of humans to peepism. There was much discussion among the peeps as many of them desired to sacrifice their fifteen minutes of fame for this position.  It was ultimately decided that a better technique would be infiltrate several of the celebrity posses, this way they could convert the celebrity who then would convert their followers.  Buffy being an expert at herd mentality was the one finally selected for this position, also being that Buffy is the center of the peep football team it was felt she could easily cross over from the sports celebrity to other groups of celebrities.

                Unfortunately Konrad’s first adventure into the new world coincided with the Super Bowl.  He was amazed by the noise, especially how loud everyone became after imbibing in certain liquids.  After further study he noticed changes in behavior after humans consumed other similar liquids or inhaled from strange smelling sticks.  On Peep there are no mind or mood altering drugs, it is just something they have never found the need for.  Konrad argued with the other Peeps that to do real research he would have to consume these products himself.  Konrad was  strangely unaffected by all the substances that he tried except for one.  After noticing a group of koalas consuming some eucalyptus, he gave that a try.  Immediately everything in his world became fuzzy and he felt a warm glow all over.  He had an unbelievable urge to cuddle under his blanket and sleep.  He had the most unbelievable dreams and just wanted to stay in that world forever.  The other peeps have become alarmed at this change in behavior and have removed all the eucalyptus from the ship, fortunately for Konrad he has many small stashes of it well hidden throughout the ship.

                Martha is the spiritual advisor of the group. All manta rays on peep are considered to be angels.  One of the luckiest things to happen to you is to be touched by one of these angels.  The peeps were quite surprised by the number of religions on earth.  They were more stunned about the hate and distrust among the different beliefs.  The peepish religion is better known as Mother Manta.  Martha leads a meditation time for all the peeps twice a day, once when everyone gets up so they can be clear headed for the day and once right before they fall asleep at night so they can clear their heads and quickly fall asleep.  This allows the peeps to only need a couple of hours of sleep a night. As the spiritual leader Martha is also in charge of weddings and funerals.</p><p>
The air on earth has a higher humidity level in it and there is much less gravity when compared to Peep.  These two features allow Martha to not only swim in the water, but to fly in the sky.  She greatly enjoys this and has been known to give the peeps rides on her back as she soars in the sky and then dives down into the ocean depths.  She hasn’t done this often yet, so not all the peeps who are brave enough to try have had an opportunity to do this.  Those who have claim it was a ride of a lifetime.

The conversion of the human race to peepism is a covert operation.  There are many different cells of peeps imbedded in human societies throughout the world.  Usually they all converse by mind melding, but at times they like to gather together to talk and socialize with their own kind.  It had proved to be difficult to find a place to have these reunions, until Hillary obtained the cooperation of the whales of the world.  She had noticed most of the world is covered with water and vast areas of the ocean are not visited by humans, even though their trash can be seen floating by.  When the peeps elect to have a gathering Hillary and the whales transport the peeps out to the middle of the Pacific Ocean or to a deserted island.  She enjoys acting as a floating island and lets the peeps slide off her tail into the ocean or tosses them in the air using her blow hole.  Hillary feels great joy as she maneuvers in the water and believes it must be similar to flying

                George was very interested in the architecture of the buildings he saw on earth.  He was amazed by the number of buildings that were left deserted and ones that were only used a couple of days a week or not for many months at a time.  He  was most in awe of the ones where large numbers of humans convened once a week and on certain other days of the year were so filled they were bursting at the seams.  He enjoyed listening to the beautiful music that was generated from these buildings.  He kept hearing the same names being referred to.  He also frequently heard these same names when people were wishing on the nuppe (stars) or just looking up toward ceiling.
              </p>
              <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9">
                George is quite tall and has the ability to blend into his surroundings, almost becoming invisible. He thought he would start answering these human pleadings from above.  All he had to do was remember all the different names that seemed to mean the same thing depending on the building or country he was in.  He felt that if the peeps could convince the human species that the information was coming from above they may believe it and change their before accordingly.  Maybe this would be a way to convert a large number of humans to peepism.  He was not very hopeful since it appeared that these different factions had been fighting for centuries even though mostly preached a common value system.

                After studying the leaders of the human species, they noticed that most of them were of the male sex, even the leaders in the smallest of communities. They also noticed that if the male leader spoke with a sense of authority, there was a good chance that at least half the people wouldn’t question much of what he said.  Leo made a case that since he was considered to be the “king of beasts” he should be in charge of providing information to the media.  Petunia felt  that she should get this job since there was an increasing presence of the female sex in leadership positions, but the peeps convinced her that the world was not yet ready to accept the leadership of a female alien life form when they would finally reveal themselves.

              <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9">
                It rapidly became clear to the peeps that most humans were living within silos, which kept reinforcing their views.  It wouldn’t matter that the peeps leaked the same information to the different silos.  It appeared that the different silos never really mixed together or listened to each other.  Leo is currently providing his information as an anonymous  source, this has worked brilliantly even if both sides talk to each other.  As soon as the one side hears anonymous source they discredit the information as unreliable, even though it is the same information.  The peeps originally thought they would easily be able to convert all the human species to peepism with this method, but soon realized most people didn’t pay attention to the talking heads on the tube.  As soon as someone said politics or wanted to talk policy most eyes glazed over and they started to think about what to have for dinner in their heads ( a mind-melding observation).  This method was still added to the conversion toolset, as it would help convert some people, just not the required numbers.

                Laurence is the head reporter for the “Peep Popular  Post”.  Normally the peeps would communicate with a mind meld, but their home planet is too far away for this to work satisfactorily, thus they are forced to use their 3D nanotube computers.  There is great interest on the planet Peep to learn about earth and the human species. Whenever Laurence has a new broadcast the entire planet comes to a standstill as they listen to Laurence tell of his adventures and the issues that the planet is facing. The peeps have found the human species to be the most bizarre life form they have encountered.  Considering the peeps home planet is in the Mayall’s Object within Ursa Major (Great Bear) and 500 million light years away that says a lot.

                 Laurence is also in charge of spreading the message of peepism throughout the world using the vast assortment of social media.  He is fascinated by the amount of social media choices he has, snapchat, facebook, tweeting, etc.  He spends endless hours posting items, following other humans and watching cute videos on YouTube.  The other peeps are becoming concerned with the amount of time he is spending on these services and have had to begin communicating with him by tweets and facebook posts.

                Prince Sergio and Princess Isabella had planned to get married on earth. They were excited to be asked to help lead the expedition to free Andre, as he was supposed to be the best man at the wedding.  The peeps had noticed that a large number of humans are excited about weddings, especially British royal weddings.  They thought their wedding would be a ratings hit, being both a royal wedding and one involving foreigners.  Prince Sergio thought freeing Andre was a simple request that anyone would grant, all he had to do was figure out who to ask.  Like any well mannered alien, he presented his current credentials to the immigration agents.  When he presented his credentials from Peep they became very excited that they discovered an actual real illegal alien.  When they contacted Washington to inquire how to proceed they were told that his country of origin was not on do not enter list so just let him in.  The immigration agents had no choice except to allow Prince Sergio to continue his journey.  He quickly returned to the Peep mobile sensing he had somehow escaped from an unseen disaster.

                Princess Isabella agreed to accompany Prince Sergio on the mission to rescue Andre, since she had always dreamed of having him at her wedding.  She felt the day would not be perfect if Andre could not be there and she was upset that the human species had taken him hostage, she felt they had some nerve to try to destroy her perfect day.  She was the leader of the group who felt that the humans should be allowed to destroy themselves if they wanted to, actually she probably would have assisted them if she could have.  These feelings were very out of character for Princess Isabella.

                On peep Princess Isabella was in charge of manners and mediation.  As you can image a mind meld can get quite out of hand if everyone tries to speak at once and there can be some long, emotionally charged debates, frequently about the most trivial things.  Princess Isabella made sure that a meld stuck to the issue.  She was excited to see how different species dealt with their disagreements and treated each other, she thought she had seen it all from the stops on other planets.  There were species that fought to the death and then ate each other to the ones that just tossed an object or guessed a number.  She had great hope for the human species when she learned that many of the groups elected who they wanted to be in charge.  She felt this way everyone would feel they had a say in how they were governed.  After watching how easily the politicians insulted each other and their followers she just wanted to pull the covers over her head and return to peep as fast as she could.

                Draco hatched from his egg on the flight from Peep to Earth, so he has no memory of the mother planet.
                He was hoping that the mission on Earth would be short, so he could return to the home he had never
                known, unfortunately that was not to be.  He was at first very excited to learn that there had been
                dragons on earth before, even if people thought they were evil.  He actually enjoyed being thought
                of as an evil creature, since that is totally opposite of the personality he has.  He fell into a
                short depression when he learned that the belief in dragons was based on fake news and false
                science, even though he had seen it on TV.   He has since learned that the belief in fake news and
                false science is a human issue and does not cross species, nor has it infected other plants in the
                solar system or other galaxies.

                Draco’s blue scales camouflages well with the sky, this has allowed him to fly all over the world
                observing the human race. He also enjoys cuddling up with the peeps under the covers on cold
                 winter nights and providing some warm air.  An added benefit of Draco is that if you ever
                  go camping and forget your matches you always have a fire starter with you.

                The peeps are by nature peaceful, fun loving creatures.  They have visited many other worlds while they were looking for a new home.  In none of these other worlds have they witnessed the violence that they have on earth, especially within the human species.  This is the first time that the peeps have seen one species depriving so many of the same species of life.  At first the peeps thought they would just make all the humans sit in a corner and have a long time out, but then they realized there would never be enough corners and none of the peeps wanted to supervise the timeout.  Then they thought of just putting the leaders in a room with marshmallow guns and nerf balls and allowing them to fight it out, but Patti didn’t want to waste the marshmallows (her and Draco had just discovered s’mores).  The peeps see settling these conflicts as one of the major problems they have to solve.  They all agree the human species has the brainpower and resources to solve the other problems, if they would only redirect the resources and brainpower they waste on these conflicts.

                After the peeps decided to save the human species they needed to make sure that they identified where all the humans were located on the planet.  This was relatively easy for them to do by splitting up the planet into zones and using the peep mobiles.  They thought they had covered the entire planet when they began hearing about the “deep state”.  They thought there were more states buried deep in the earth that they had missed.  Prudence loved to tunnel deep so she volunteered to begin the search for the “deep states”.  After much searching she could find nothing.  After some thought the peeps realized that the “deep state” was also being called a “shadow government” and you wouldn’t have a good shadow underground, so the “deep state” must be somewhere else.  They then quickly realized it referred to a group of humans who were secretly running the government.  This is just what the peeps needed to create to help convert the human species to peepism.  If they formed a “deep state” they could easily manipulate government policies.  Prudence volunteered to lead this effort since she enjoyed tunneling deeply into things whether it was in the dirt or the various government organizations. She is also excellent at working with a group to form a community and hiding from others in a deep web of tunnels.

                 between individuals. Patti agreed to sacrifice herself and be embedded into the lifestyle of
                 the average United States citizen.  This involved drastic changes in her life style.  Peeps
                 consider themselves to be vegetarians, they abhor all types of violence and consider eating
                 flesh of any kind to be a barbaric behavior.  Peep has considerably more species of flora
                  than does earth.  This makes it easier to create a meal with many different textures and a

                with a peep who has done that activity sometime in the past or is currently performing
                that activity and you actually experience that event or activity. The peeps don’t like

                After arriving on earth the peeps quickly realized that the human race was on top of the food chain and thus were the ones endangering the entire planet.  They thought it would be easy to talk to the humans since they were only one species, how hard could it be?  They quickly learned how wrong they were, lucky they only tried contacting a few humans.  When Petunia mind melded with a human they wouldn’t want to communicate, they said they only wanted to talk in their native tongue.  When Petunia tried that they wouldn’t talk to her because she didn’t look like anything they had talked to before.  They didn’t like that she was soft and fuzzy, they felt she was definitely hiding something beneath all that fur.  Petunia was determined that there must be some way to reach the human species.  That was when she discovered children. The peeps were hoping that if they reached the human species before they reached maturity they could alter the future of the planet.  It was easy for them to infiltrate the lives of children, who already had an assortment of stuffed creatures that resembled peeps, so they slipped right in.  The peeps also quickly learned that the stories of children were usually ignored by the adult world.  Rarely did an adult listen to the tales of the talking peeps and those who did felt they were raising the next J.R.R. Tolkien  or J.K. Rowling.  Petunia is starting to show some wear from all the tears she has wiped, floors she has been dragged on, and tea parties she has attended.  But the children are what caused Petunia to vote to save the species and earth.

She found it refreshing to scale these treacherous peaks and enjoyed the beautiful sunsets and sunrises in isolated peace.  The other peeps also found it relaxing to mind meld with her at these times so they too could enjoy the serenity.

              <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9">
                It quickly became obvious to the peeps that they would be staying on earth for sometime if they were to save the planet.  They were becoming stressed from all the obstacles to their mission that kept cropping up.  The human species was fighting with them every step of the way, even if it would save them.  The peeps are very logical creatures and thus had great difficulty understanding this self-destructive and irrational behavior.  They needed to do something about the build-up stress and depression.  It was LaLa to the rescue.  After viewing a few beautiful sunsets and sunrises they could feel their blood pressure drop and depression lift.  Now the peeps send LaLa off to the mountains at least once a week so they can get their dose of hope.
                After enjoying many of these trips LaLa decided she should give something back to the communities that had helped her along the way.  Now she is the wool supplier to several small weaving businesses in these communities.  She not only is able to supply them with an endless amount of fine wool, but can transport their products to distribution points and bring back much needed supplies to the community.  LaLa has noted an uptick in her mood from doing this and a more positive view of the human species, she now believes there is some hope.

                On July 4th, 1947, Andre’s life changed forever.  He was sent to earth from the
                planet Peep, to evaluate if the human race was worth saving.   Stray fireworks
                struck his ship as he circled over Roswell, New Mexico.  The crowd below thought
                the resulting explosion and noise was just another one of the fireworks, but
                some of the Air Force pilots attending knew this was not the case.  They quickly
                 returned to the base to search for any remains from the crash.  They instantly
                 spotted the fluorescent lime green alien, who was gravely injured and
                 unconscious as a result of the accident.  They rapidly cleaned up the crash site
                  and brought Andre to the base.  It was determined that there would be wide
                  spread panic in the world if the existence of Andre was revealed.  Thus he
                  remained in captivity until the other Peeps were able to rescue him.  This is
                  one of the very few pictures of Andre, he rarely stays sitting in one place
                  for long, especially if there are humans in the area, even if he has been
                  guaranteed that they are friendly.  He is always afraid they will force him to
                  return is his life as a living experiment and later dissect him.

      <h2>Peep Heros</h2>
      <p>
        The peeps have very few heros.  They don’t believe in hero worship or the need for role models.  They value the uniqueness of the individual and believe that the more heterogenous the group the stronger the group.  This at times has led to some late nights and heated discussions as they try to solve a problem.  They have learned to discuss the idea and not let the issue become to personal or to attack the peep.  As the diversity of the peeps has grown so has their ability to come up with novel solutions to problems.  That is partially why they have advanced well past the human race. That being said they currently have three heros or beings they strongly admire.

          One of the few regrets the peeps have is never having had a chance to mind meld with A. A. Milne.  They believe he was one of the few humans who would have accepted the peeps for what they are, very brilliant alien beings.  The peeps first became aware of his existence when they observed children cuddled up on the laps of their parents being read to from his books.  This gave the peeps a feeling that there was some good in the human species.  They at times have been known to sneak under the warm covers and listen to the stories.
          It also provided the peeps with a way to reach the human species.  Children were very willing to mind meld with the peeps and thought it not strange at all that they could talk to each other by mind melding.  Also adults didn’t think it was strange if a child talked aloud to a peep, they thought the child was just imagining. The children were easy to convert to peepism, they had yet to become cynical or fear the outside world, except for the occasional monster under the bed or in the closet.  They believed the world ahead held an endless list of possibilities and adventures.  They thought the world could be easily saved in a decade or so, but then the human children entered adolescence and the peeps almost gave up hope.  The adolescence humans at that age appeared to stop thinking rationally and didn’t want to admit to anyone that they were carrying on conversations with aliens.  They wanted to go along with the crowd.  The peeps noticed that this was not true for all the human adolescents, so they continued to work with the ones that kept their inner child alive.  They also noticed they could reach the human adults cuddled up with the children.  They seemed to remembering their childhoods and the imaginary worlds that they had created.  They were willing to help the peeps, since they wanted to save the world for their children.  This has given the peeps some hope, but they now realize that the saving of the human race is more complicated than they had first thought.

      <p>Ursula was one of the first life forms on earth befriended by the peeps.  They consider
        her a hero since she has overcome great hardship and she is still helping the human race
        even after how they destroyed her world.  She has pledged her life to protect them and
        assist them in any way she can to spread peepism in the human species.  The humans are her
        sworn enemy and personally she wouldn’t bother to save them, but knows that the future of
        the earth is tied to them.

        Prudence was the peep that found Ursula.  Prudence was happily tunneling away with a group
        of prairie dogs that she had recently befriended.  They were seeing who could tunnel the deepest,
        of course Prudence was the winner.  She was striving to go another few inches when she suddenly
        broke through the ceiling of a dark and musty cave.  Ursula was all alone huddled in a corner
        where she had been sleeping for centuries.  Realizing that neither of them spoke a similar
        language, they quickly learned to mind meld together.  This was easy for Ursula since all alicorns
         have telepathic abilities.  Ursula was greatly surprised by all the noise in the meld, but
         soon was able to identify all the different peep voices.  She quickly spilled her unique story.
         Ursula it turns out had been sealed in the underground cave since the fall of Middle Earth
         centuries earlier. The elves had wanted to protect the last alicorn ( a cross between a unicorn
          and pegasus, a horse like creature with wings) so they sealed her up.  Ursula was a much beloved
         creature of the elves. They valued her for her beauty, intelligence and the healing powers of her
          horn.  Ursula and her kind would sacrifice parts of their horn to the creatures of Middle Earth
           when they were gravely ill or mortally injured.  An alicorn is able to regenerate their horn
           over time, but some must be left to start the regeneration.  When the human species learned of
           the powers of the alicorn horn they were overcome with greed for it.  They were not able to
           restrain themselves and would slaughter any alicorn they found and would remove the entire horn.
             Thus when the fall of Middle Earth became imminent they sealed her in the cave. Ursula continues
          to live in the cave during the daytime hours to remain out of site of the humans, but frequently
          assists the peeps during the nighttime.

        Several times a week she loads several of the peeps on her back and takes them up to the aurora borealis
         to harvest stardust (micrometeorites or pixiedust to humans).  They are after two types, the tumblers
         and the sternschnuppe (nuppe for short).  The tumblers are the chrysalises that have been released from
         Peep and contain the peeps ready to transform into the peep army on earth.  The peeps try to collect
         as many of them as possible from the aurora borealis before they reach earth and can be found and
         destroyed by their enemies.  This also saves them time because they are more concentrated on the aurora
          and they don’t have to spend time searching for them all over the planet.  The search can greatly
          reduce the amount of free time that the peeps have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sternschnuppe or nuppe are the other type of stardust that the peeps collect.  The peeps are
          using several different strategies to convert the human race to peepism.  One of them is to have
          some humans feel indebted to them.  They are accomplishing this by granting wishes to some humans.
          Each nuppe that the peeps collect has one human wish in it, a wish a desperate or hopeful human made
          on a star.  The peeps study all these wishes and then choose to grant some of them.  They are not
          able to grant all the wishes, there are way too many and some are impossible for the peeps to
          currently grant.  They are working with Ursula to find a way to regenerate her horn at a more
          rapid pace so the healing powers can be more widespread.  Many times when you hear there has
          been a miracle cure or unbelievable recovery the peeps and Ursula have been at work. Many of
          the wishes that the peeps grant are easier than this.  They are just cases where the human needed
          to work harder or have more belief in themselves.  The peeps are able to fulfill these wishes
          by unknowingly mind melding with the human.  In many of these cases the human wants to thank
          someone for granting their wish, in these cases the peeps have quietly revealed themselves and
          are converting these humans willingly to peepism.The peeps always save part of each day for
          fun and a new adventure.  Ursula is critical to many of these activities.  The peeps love the
          water and would spend every minute on earth swimming with the fish if they could.  Many
          nights after Ursula has brought the peeps back from collecting the stardust she will stop
          and pick up other Peeps and take them to an isolated reef where they can dive with all the
          marine life.  This is the peeps favorite activity and one that they will never tire of.
          Many nights they return for a quick nap just as the sun is rising.

          The peeps also have come to admire Dr. John Goodenough who at age 94 is filing another patent.  Being told he is too old is a statement the peeps are sure he is familiar with.  He appears to have first encountered this statement when he was told he was too old to begin studying physics at the University of Chicago in 1943.  He has spent a large part of his career studying batteries and trying to come up with one that could be used by cars and thus wean the human species from their dependency on fossil fuels.  The planet Peep doesn’t possess any fossil fuels, so they were quite surprised when they visited some of the larger cities and noticed the smog from all the cars.  They felt this distracted from their ability to explore the cities, so they support anyone working to reduce this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The peeps are a very tenacious species, which has helped them advance so far past the humans. This was especially helpful when they thought Peep might be destroyed.  There were many times they just wanted to give up, but someone in the meld would always convince them to keep going. They admire someone who can keep plugging away at a problem for decades, and would welcome his knowledge in the mind meld.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the peeps were working to save Peep many things in their culture changed.  They still took time to enjoy themselves and celebrate things, since they discovered when they had time to relax they frequently came back and easily solved some problem they had been working on.  But there wasn’t time to celebrate events for individual peeps, such as birthdays.  After they realized Peep would survive (March 30), they decided to have this be the birthday for all peeps.  Peeps do not keep track of their age, they believe age is  irrelevant, so they were surprised how the human species seems to categorize people by it.  They were surprised that humans believed you could become too old to learn new things.  They found the saying “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks”  very strange, they thought the old dog was now smart enough to only perform when it wanted to.  They admire that Dr. Goodenough has kept learning throughout his life and continues to ignore the view of some humans that you can become too old to be creative.

    <h2>Purpose of Site</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Peep Power.  This site is an illustration of what a person can learn by
      taking numerous free on-line classes from Coursera, Udacity, edX , freecodecamp and
      many other on-line tutorials.  I was loyal to them all until some started to charge
      a fee to gain access to all their material.  So now my loyalty is to edX and freecodecamp.  This
      site illustrates what I have learned after many, many hours or thousands of life moments.
      I would like to say it was fun, which it was, but at times it was some of the most
      frustrating hours of my life, just ask my family members who had to deal with me.</p>
    <p>The peeps were a creation after my children moved out of the house and got on with
      their own lives. There now was no one to blame for the light left on, using the
      last of the milk, the general mess, so the Peeps came to the rescue. They will hopefull
      provide an endless amount of content.
    </p>
    <p>

The pages were designed using HTML5, scss and javascript.  I also used normalize.scss to insure a common starting point,
autoprefixer, and gulp.  All the html and css code was validated using W3's validator.  I used colorsafe.co to help select the
color palette for the site.  The accessibility was checked using wave.webaim.org.   The site is hosted on heroku. The server
code uses nodejs and express.  Handlebars was used for the templates for some of the pages. Several of the pages use MongoDB
and access various APIs. I am currently also trying to learn React, D3 and es6 and hope to incorporate some of those things
in this site. All the code in located on <a href="https://github.com/tanya53/peep_power_production">https://github.com/tanya53/peep_power_production</a> and /peep_power_server.  All the photos without credits were
taken by myself or by other members of my family.
